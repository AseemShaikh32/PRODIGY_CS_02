Pixel Mnipulation for Image Encryption. Developed a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. Where you can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. It allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

This Python script provides functionalities to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple encryption algorithm based on XOR operation. It also allows users to swap the RGB values of pixels in an image.

## Functionality

1. **Encryption**: Encrypts an image using a provided encryption key.
2. **Decryption**: Decrypts an encrypted image using the corresponding decryption key.
3. **Pixel Swapping**: Swaps the RGB values of pixels in an image.
4. **User Interaction**: The script prompts the user to choose between encryption, decryption, pixel swapping, or exiting the program.

## Usage

1. **Encrypting an Image**: Run the script and choose the encryption option. Enter the path to the image file and the encryption key when prompted. The encrypted image will be displayed.

2. **Decrypting an Image**: Choose the decryption option, enter the decryption key, and the original image will be displayed if the decryption is successful.

3. **Swapping Pixels**: Select the option to swap pixels, and the image with swapped RGB values will be displayed.

4. **Exiting the Program**: Choose the exit option to terminate the program.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Python Imaging Library (Pillow)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
